# AI-Resume-Screening-System
Developed an AI-based Resume Screening System using Python, spaCy, pdfminer.six, and docx2txt to automatically extract skills from multiple resumes and score candidates against job requirements with ~90% accuracy. The system processes resumes sequentially, handles unsupported formats, and generates CSV reports to support efficient HR shortlisting.
